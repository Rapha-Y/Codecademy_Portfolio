                My first insight into the world of web development happened in 2011, through HTML being
                part of the IT subject in middle school. A spark of passion for web design was ignited in
                there, but it wasn't until much later that I would decide on a career.

                In parallel to high school, I studied mechatronics, a certificate program that combined 
                mechanics, electrics and IT - Where we were introduced to C#, my first programming language.
                Seeing I enjoyed coding, but not mechanics, I decided to continue my studies in the 
                specific field.

                During university I was presented to C, Java and SQL, as well as many concepts linked to 
                behind-the-scenes programming, which I didn't dislike, but proved to be exhausting. In 2019, 
                however, I was assigned to make an app with a small team of students, where I was assigned 
                to front-end development, and I realized that was a possible path to pursue.

                After graduating, with renewed interest, I've been dedicating my time to learning how to 
                become a good web developer, while searching for a job.
